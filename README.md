## About me

I lead the mobile team (iOS + Android) for a large-scale consumer app with 2M+ users, live in 20+ countries 🌍
I help set the product’s architecture, technical direction and collaborate with backend and design team.

To keep us best-in-class in our space, we’re constantly running A/B experiments focused on engagement, retention and revenue. I measure and analyze the results using the market-leading platform Databricks, great for data engineering and analysis.
From there, I turn insights into actionable product decisions and roadmap priorities.
I care about UX, performance and scalability.

Outside of work, I’m deeply passionate about maths & physics, robotics and networking. 🤖
I run my own self-hosted cloud services, DNS, VPN, file system, etc
Privacy is a human right 🔒

## What I work with

**Core disciplines**
- SwiftUI
- UIKit
- Combine
- Xcode Cloud / Fastlane / Bitrise CI


- Electrical engineering (embedded systems, circuits, signal basics)
- Applied mathematics & physics (mechanics, control, numerics – in progress)

## Strenghts

## Weaknesses
- Can be a bit perfectionist


**Systems / infrastructure**
- Self-hosting (homelab, backup strategies, monitoring)
- Networking: DNS, Encrypted File storage, VPN, Proxy
- Cloud: self-hosted storage and services

**Robotics & hardware**
- Microcontrollers (e.g. Arduino / STM32 / ESP32 – adjust as appropriate)
- Sensors, actuators, and basic control loops
- Prototyping with breadboards and PCBs

**Interests**
- Privacy-preserving architectures
- Secure communication protocols
- Automation and tooling around dev environments

---

## Current focus

- Building robust, user-friendly **iOS apps** with a strong focus on reliability and performance  
- Learning more advanced **math and physics** relevant to robotics and control  
- Improving my **self-hosted infrastructure** (resilience, observability, security)  
- Experimenting with **robotics projects** that combine software, hardware, and control theory

## How I work

- I like **clean, well-documented code** and small, composable abstractions.  
- I prefer **understanding the stack end-to-end**: from hardware and protocols up to UI.  
- I care a lot about **security, privacy, and reproducibility** in my setups and code.
